# IAS3Perl

This site is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/ias3perl/ias3perl.github.io](https://github.com/ias3perl/ias3perl.github.io). 

## Use Cases

We've started developing and documenting various use cases for this project on the [use cases](/usecases/) page.

# Communication 

There are a few preferred methods to communicate with the group. We use github to coordinate code and development activities. For longer and often non-code related discussions we leverage IRC and a Mailing List. 

## IRC
We maintain an IRC channel on irc.perl.org at #ias3perl.

## Mailing List

Mailing list information can be found at [http://lists.ias3perl.org/listinfo.cgi/ias3perl-ias3perl.org](http://lists.ias3perl.org/listinfo.cgi/ias3perl-ias3perl.org).
